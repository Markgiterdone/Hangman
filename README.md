Ahh ... this was tough on me in a number of ways:

First - I was struggling with how to structure the file (major sections).  Jared really helped with an example for other kinds of code he writes

Second -- It was hard to wrap my head around function calls and how they are labled ... I think I got it now

Third -- Game logic ... this slowed me down a lot ... I should have started with this at first.  It is more than just the logic in that it is also how you show it (var changes, number indicators, etc.)

I am glad this one is under my belt ...
